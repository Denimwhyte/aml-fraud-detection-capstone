AML Analytics List
1. Descriptive Analytics
Understanding the dataset
Total number of transactions
Transactions per minute
Average, minimum, and maximum transaction amounts
Distribution of transaction types (Deposit, Withdrawal, Transfer)
Success vs failed transactions
Transactions by device (Mobile, Desktop, Tablet)
Transactions by network slice
Transactions by location (latitude/longitude, pin code)
2. Behavioural Analytics
Accounts’ typical behaviour
Number of transactions per sender
Number of transactions per receiver
Average amount per account
Time‑of‑day patterns (morning, afternoon, night)
Number of devices used by each account
Frequency of device switching
Typical location per account
Distance between consecutive transactions
Changes in behaviour within the day
3. AML Anomaly Detection
Suspicious behaviour patterns
Round‑number amounts (e.g., ending in .00 or .50)
High‑value transactions above a chosen threshold
Rapid transactions within the same minute (velocity checks)
Structuring or smurfing: many small deposits under a threshold
Device switching in a short period
Location jumps that are impossible based on time
Multiple failed transactions before a successful one
Transactions at unusual times
Sudden changes in transaction type or behaviour
4. Risk Scoring
Combining suspicious signals
Assign weights to each rule
Add up the triggered rules
Produce a final suspiciousness score
Rank accounts or transactions by risk
5. Dashboard Analytics

6. Analytics (more advanced)
Going beyond the basics
Clustering accounts by behaviour
Time‑series anomaly detection within the day, such as:
an account that normally sends 1–2 transactions suddenly sending 20
an account that usually sends £50–£200 suddenly sending £2,000
activity spikes at unusual times
a sudden burst of small deposits (structuring)
a sudden drop or stop in activity
Network analysis (sender to receiver relationships)
